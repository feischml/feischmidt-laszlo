    <p class="paragraph">It is about taking action, making constantly decisions in good times and hard ones. Find your
      <strong>WHY</strong> and pursue it by making an obsession out of it, build it step by step. 
      Learn to fail and fail to learn. Each evaluated experience can shape one's character. Do the
      <strong>WORK</strong>, be
      <strong>CONSISTENT</strong> and try to get better each day. You can be the architect of your own life – health, relationships, work experience.
      If you don’t lead yourself, somebody else will. Surround yourself with people who resonate with your ideas, principles
      – they will lift you up and as a consequence you will lift others up.</p>
